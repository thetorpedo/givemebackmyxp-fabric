Players will drop a set percentage from their XP when they die.

Default is set to 70%. Change on the config file.

Fabric API required.

Note: This is the percentage of the player total experience, not their levels.
Example: A value of 0.7 means 70% of the total XP will be returned.
If a player has 30 levels (which equals 1395 XP) when they die, they will drop 976 XP (70% of 1395), which is approximately 25 levels.
Keep in mind that XP required per level is not linear. Higher levels need more XP.
